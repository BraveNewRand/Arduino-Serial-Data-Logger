# Arduino-Serial-Data-Logger

This is an Arduino script that reads data from a sensor (like a temperature or light sensor) and sends it to a computer via serial communication. There is also a small Python script that reads this serial data and logs it into a text file.

Why this is useful: This kind of tool is fundamental in many mechatronics projects where data collection and monitoring are needed. It's also a great example of interfacing hardware with software, which is core to mechatronics.
